Description: Provides a client-server based interface to he the 2 stage symmetric eigenvalue decomposition (dsyevdx_2stage_m()) multi-gpu/single-gpu routine from the MAGMA library. Can be used as replacement for the eigen() function in R for symmetric, double precision (the default in R) matrices. We get the server to check how many GPUs are present therefore we do not need CUDA/other interface to be present for compilation of the MagmaEigenNonsym package. required is the MAGMA library available (http://icl.cs.utk.edu/magma/) compiled as position independent code with a multi-threaded high performance LAPACK and -DMAGMA_ILP64 defined (an example make.inc file should be available in MAGMA download package).
